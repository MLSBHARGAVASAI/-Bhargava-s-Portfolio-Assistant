# 🤖 Bhargava's Portfolio Chatbot

Hello! I am **Bhargava Sai's AI Assistant**, inspired by **ELIZA**, one of the earliest natural language processing programs. Just like ELIZA, I use **pattern matching** to understand your messages and respond appropriately. I can answer your questions about skills, projects, achievements, education, certifications, and more!

## About ELIZA

**ELIZA** was created in the 1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. It used **simple pattern-matching rules** to simulate conversation, often giving users the feeling they were talking to a real person. My chatbot follows a similar approach to provide **interactive responses** about Bhargava Sai’s portfolio.

## How I Work

I respond based on **recognized patterns in your input**.  

For example:  

| You Ask | I Reply |
|----------|---------|
| "Tell me your skills" | 💡 I tell you about programming languages, frameworks, and soft skills. |
| "What projects have you done?" | 🚀 I list portfolio projects, descriptions, and links. |
| "Show achievements" | 🏆 I display awards, hackathons, and recognitions. |
| "I am John" | 😊 Nice to meet you, John! How can I assist you today? |
